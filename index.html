                    <p>A margarita is a cocktail consisting of Tequila, triple sec, and lime juice often served with salt on the rim of the glass.

                    <p>Mojito is a traditional Cuban punch. The cocktail often consists of five ingredients: white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, soda water, and mint. Its combination of sweetness, citrus, and herbaceous mint flavours is intended to complement the rum, and has made the mojito a popular summer drink.</p>
